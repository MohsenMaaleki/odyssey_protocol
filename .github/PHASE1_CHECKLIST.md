## Ready for Deployment

### Commands to Run:

```bash
# 1. Validate configuration
npm run pre-deploy

# 2. Deploy to Devvit
npm run deploy

# 3. Install to test subreddit via Reddit web UI
# https://developers.reddit.com/apps

# 4. Create test post and launch app

# 5. Run smoke tests (see SMOKE_TEST.md)
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Immediate Checks
- [ ] App launches in Reddit post
- [ ] UI renders correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] HUD displays

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Mission flow (IDLE → RESULT)
- [ ] Post Data persistence
- [ ] Realtime HUD updates
- [ ] Countdown timers
- [ ] Gallery save/load
- [ ] Leaderboard tracking
- [ ] Unlock system
- [ ] Moderator permissions

### Log Review
- [ ] Check Devvit logs for errors
- [ ] Verify scheduled actions run
- [ ] Confirm realtime messages sent
- [ ] No missing context errors

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is **COMPLETE** when:

- ✅ All smoke tests pass
- ✅ No critical errors in production
- ✅ All core systems functional
- ✅ Performance acceptable
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

- Scheduler uses console.log (TODO: implement actual Devvit Scheduled Actions)
- Post Data adapter ready but using Redis fallback (inject `devvitPostDataApi` when available)
- Gallery limited to 500 entries
- Leaderboard shows top players only

## Phase 2 Planning

After Phase 1 validation, consider:

- [ ] Advanced mission types
- [ ] Multiplayer features
- [ ] Enhanced gallery with AI-generated patches
- [ ] Community voting system
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Mission replay/history
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Mobile-specific UI improvements
